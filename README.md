# Habit Builder

A mobile application that helps you build habits by keeping track of goals and progress

## What this is

I wanted to give myself a challenge to build an app over the course of a 3 day weekend. Because of this, my goal was not as much a fully deployed app as it was a finished product.

## Deployment

While I may go back and get this application on the app store proper, at the moment, it is only manually deployable.

I chose the following tech stack based on a mix of personal familiarity and convenience:

* Ionic
